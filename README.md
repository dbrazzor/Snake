## React, Canvas & Snake

Pretty small canvas' based snake game. Built with React, Redux, react-konva and material-ui, I tried to make it as easy and generic as I could, it should be easily reusable in any other context. I used the Material Design box-shadows, created by Samuel Thornton.
You can try it out [here](https://snake.thomasgrivet.fr). (if not there might be a problem, please notify me on this!)

Have a nice day üêç
